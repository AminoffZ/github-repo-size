# Privacy Policy

We take your privacy seriously. To better protect your privacy we provide this privacy policy notice explaining the way your personal information is collected and used.

## Links to Third Party Websites

We have included links on this page for your use and reference. We are not responsible for the privacy policies on these websites. You should be aware that the privacy policies of these websites may differ from our own.

## OAuth

We provide an easy way to authenticate GitHub's API with OAuth. As a necessary step of authenticating this way, your e-mail address will be stored in a [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) database. We **do not** use or share this information with anyone else. This is completely optional and we recommend using a GitHub PAT token for authentication which is not stored or shared at all.

## Security

The security of your personal information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Changes To This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is effective as of **December 24, 2023** and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page.

We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time and you should check this Privacy Policy periodically. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will be placing a prominent notice on our [GitHub](https://github.com/AminoffZ/github-repo-size) and [Chrome Web Store Page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-repo-size/jpdmfnflpdgefbfkafcikmhipofhanfl).
